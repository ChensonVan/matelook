message=A lot of people tell me I don't need a relationship, but to be honest, it would be nice to have someone to share experiences with. I know I have plenty of friends that I do heaps of things with, but I want someone that I have a deeper level of intimacy and a deeper connection with. Let's go watch movies that make us question everything, let's go watch movies that are stupid asf and have no point other than comedy, let's go climb a mountain to see waterfall and stand under it for no apparent reason, let's take naps for the heck of it because we can. I just want someone that I can share on these experiences with and who I can myself around, is it bad to want that. I feel like the guys I meet at uni can't connect with me on that level and I just wish someone felt the same way
