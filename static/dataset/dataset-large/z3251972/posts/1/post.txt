message=Hi H\nAs USDY love letter is broken, but this is a letter to an USDY guy I met on tinder.\nYou amazed me by Friday night bike riding. The moment That I held your waist tight gives my best trust in you. You have no idea how scared I was in every turn around or speed up. But I didn't scream but trusted you so much. It felt like the longest ride I ever had, exciting and nervous as I had no idea who I had a ride with. And then we spent hours chatting in bars and by the beach and even in campus. Finally you sent me home. The adventure was over.\nYou said you would type your numbers again on tinder but apparently u didn't but just said thank me for the fun night and wish me a good weekend. That's enough. You're leaving soon as u said anyway, it's impossible for us to expect more than a good night.\nI like your voice, you know that? And your big hands ;) I wish we could meet again in the future, but I know that people say if guys don't text you, they don't really have you in mind. So I guess it's clear that you just wanted a chillout and a company but that's it. It was actually my first tinder date/meet/catchup, whatever it calls. But it was beautiful for me, I think. Thank you! \nFrom a girl who adore you but will keep this feeling inside.
