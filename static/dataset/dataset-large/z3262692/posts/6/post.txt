message=Watching The PILLOWMAN gave me feelings I haven't had in a long time and I can hardly describe it because there are so MANY feelings. The cast (and behind the scenes) was absolutely amazing and I'm in love with every member, so if I see you on campus I will be fangirling really hard or just really shyly following from a distance. Prior to this, I was so sad I missed out on zetland but I could NOT care less right now. 10/10 THANK YOUS for putting me in this mood <3
