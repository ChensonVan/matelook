message=Hi, im a fresher med girl who is deeply infatuated with one, Michael Joubert. I can't keep my eyes of his rockin bod, and every time i see his at Wallace Wurth my heart swelters. Normally i exclusively date 6ft. boys, and although you are well below average height i can make an exception with those chisled cheeks. Usually i like my men with decent hair cuts coverage, but again when we start dating im sure that will fix itself. Yours Truly SH.
