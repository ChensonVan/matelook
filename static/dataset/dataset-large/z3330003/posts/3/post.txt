message=To the tall indian guy in 2nd year law, Samir, the lawPLUS mentor, I think you are a god and I would subscribe to your religion. Hard. I really like you but I dont feel like I have a shot because you are just too amazing, and so far above us peasants. I just want you to know that every first year wants you, you’re so hot. I will be waiting to make my move at lawlapalooza... What’s your favourite song? ;)
