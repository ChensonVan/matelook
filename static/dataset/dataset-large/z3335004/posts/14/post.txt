message=As the time for me to enter class arrives, the only thing i have to look forward to is her... her name is Carrie and she has the most beautiful hair that can only be compared to a llama. As she parts her lips and raises her voice to a shriek- i can tell that she's a banshee (her unusually high voice). From the clamour of daily conversation, I know that she is friends with a Mr Currie. Oh lord! Please give me a chance with Carrie- she sits in front of me in material science- so close yet so far. Senpai Scarrie please notice me !!!\nxxooo
