message=William Chan. I have been in love with your girl all throughout uni. I love the way she smiles, how she cares for everyone, how she gets excited easily and how she makes any situation fun and memorable. If I had her, I would never be bored of her and i will be grateful. I hate the emotional strain that you cause her. It is always the same thing. You act like you don't care about her. You don't talk to her. It hurts her because she doesn't want to start a fight and through consoling with me she feels better and holds it in.\nI keep telling her to break up with you but for some unknown reason she won't. If only that love was directed towards me instead.
