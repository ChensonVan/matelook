message=I've always believed that the future isnt something to rack your brain over and more depends on how happy you are right now, in the present. Life is painfully unpredictable, maybe you guys stick maybe you guys wont but holding things up against a future will give you a definite answer. Honesty and truth is way to go, oh and as a guy, time is the greatest medicine.
