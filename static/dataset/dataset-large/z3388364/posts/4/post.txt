message=Dear UNSW Love Letters\n\nRemember that one chick that refused to be happy? Yeah I kinda need a replacement for her. Her heart seemed to have stopped beating after I took it out to check whether or not she had one. So cold to ignore my attempts to cheer her up. But anyway I digress and if there are any chicks here that would love to be her replacement I would be very very grateful. Please comment if you are into BDSM, torture and a kinky sex life. If you don't comment I will find you, I will rope you and you will marry me.
