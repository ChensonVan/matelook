message=To one of the most cheerful, positive individuals,\nI met you at a CSE Revue event a while back and haven't stopped appreciating the happiness you bring with you everywhere.\nWe've gotten closer and I've realised that sometimes you were just putting on a brave face. Sometimes those around you don't realise how much you give to make others happy. I've told you I'll always be there for you and to make you laugh when times are rough.\nI just want you to know that all our mutuals love the person you are. Always.\nWe're a family and look out for one another yeah?\n\nFrom an appreciative revue-addict who wouldn't know what to do without your support. xx
