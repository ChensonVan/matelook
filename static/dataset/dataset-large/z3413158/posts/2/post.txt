message=You're in TPS lecture... and are always surrounded by people (coz you're just such a great guy). We hung out one morning before our lecture. Now, we talk sometimes but only occasionally and I'm just coming to realise how I think I feel about you... but we won't likely see each other until end of semester. I don't know if you'll know who I am or not... but I hope you do. And I'm hoping, maybe, you feel the same way?
