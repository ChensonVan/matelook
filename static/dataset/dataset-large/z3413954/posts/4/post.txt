message=To detective clarice\n\nYou were wearing gym clothes and tiny bright orange shorts that really showed off your butt, walking up the main walkway on thursday around 5.30pm. You looked so beautiful and fit and dat ass ;). You were giggling to yourself with the most amazing smile. I couldn't help but ask what was so funny. You were listening to Calvin Harris Sweet Nothing and swore the lyrics were "you're giving me sexy elephants". You are possibly the cutest thing I've ever come across! and I have patted a koala. I want more of that adorable smile. You had to leave before i could get your number. I hope you see this! Let me take you out or at least will you come with me to the roundhouse party next week?
