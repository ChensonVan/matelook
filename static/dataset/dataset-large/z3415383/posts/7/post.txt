message=To the beautiful Indian goddess, sitting at the library lawn steps (17/08/2016 @ 2:45).\nWearing the dark blue cardigan,olive green shirt and eating the blue fairy floss.\nYou're mesmerising eyes had me at the moment you took a bite at the fairy floss and our eyes met. Three of your friends turned around and had a quick glance at me and that was when our souls intertwined. I knew you were the queen to my heart. From the three idiots that were sitting 45 degrees from your direction.\nThe colours of our tees matched..I just hope our souls do too. \nCare for a cup of coffee?\nLibrary lawn at 11 on 22/08/2016\n\nYours truly ~ secret admirer
