message=To all the conservative girls out there, \nIf you like a guy, hell if you even just wanna be all over him, just grow up and tell him.\n\nThere is nothing a guy appreciates more than just blunt honesty. And, there is nothing wrong with a girl asking out a guy, this is 2016 people...\n\nIt's not going to hurt to ask him, and it might not even be obvious that we might be interested in you aswell,  but we're busy people too, and we don't have the time to play games with you. Some of us just don't get hints.\n\nAnd if he does reject you, then deal with it, like we do all the time. Take that as a good thing and move on. One sided relationships aren't going to happen.\n\nSame applies to you gays out there. If you're too worried to ask someone out because they might not be gay and they'll get offended, then good, you shouldn't associate yourselves with them anyway.
