message=Cecile, I never thought I'd have a thing for someone like you, mainly because you're a first year and I just found out how old you're turning this week. But you make me smile- you're always energetic and so much fun to be around. I don't think you realise how gorgeous and amazing you are and that's what makes you even more beautiful and down to earth. I'm not one for grand gestures and I'm being completely honest so I really do hope you see this.
