message=Dear Single guys and girls:\nStop complaining about how the opposite sex is not talking with you, or you have no chance to talk to them.\nIf you want people to approach you, try your best to not walk or go to lecture with a group of friends, it is very intimidating for anyone to approach a group.\nNo one is ever going to approach a group! \nWalk and Sit in lectures alone!  It is much easier for people to start conversations with you!\nYours Sincerely
