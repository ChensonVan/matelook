message=Kelvin, I matched with you on tinder on 11/09 and we started talking not long after the match. I started the convo and when you replied, you mentioned that I was cute and we spoke about our weekends. You went to see flight facilities the night before and played basketball with friends during the day. I mentioned I worked and you then asked where. I was about to reply but I decided to click on your profile again and when I went back to reply, the conversation disappeared and we were unmatched. I was quite interested in getting to know you but if you unmatched me then this is awkward.... If you didn't then I hope you see this and maybe like this comment and i'll be sure to talk to you on Facebook. We have no mutual friends and all you had on your profile was that you attended UNSW so fingers crossed you see this and you know who I am!
