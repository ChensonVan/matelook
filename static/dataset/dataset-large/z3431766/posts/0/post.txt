message=Dear asian cutie studying international studies (i think, judging from your apparent fanatacism with global issues),\n\nI see you around uni on Mondays and Wednesdays and I think your name is Roys or Royce? You have a birthmark on your face that looks like a battle scar and it makes me so hot thinking about where it might have come from! I've overheard you talk about teaching in an orphanage overseas and wouldn't mind being disciplined a little myself ;)
