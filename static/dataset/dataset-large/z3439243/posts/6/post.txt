message=To Tin,\n\nI see your luscious locks floating through Wallace Wurth, and it gives the feeling that nothing is impossible. Though your name denotes a cheap metal, your heart is the substance of gold.I heard you talking about breast exams, you can borrow mine any day. I love your caveman style, especially those bare-ass, unapologetic feet. You can bone me any day. Lay me down on a mammoth rug, and drive your spear into me. Yass, daddy.\n\nFrom yours truly,\nWallace Gurth
