message=Hey UNSW Love Letters, I'll tell you about my old crush.\nShe was among the smartest people I had met up until that point, and we got on extremely well. We spent hours of time chatting to each other over the internet instead of studying for the our exams (time well spent, given we both ended up with straight HDs). She asked me to the SciSoc ball, clarifying it was just as friends. It felt like we were becoming more than friends, but after the ball, she became quite withdrawn. It turns out she had caught on that I liked her, but didn't reciprocate. When I heard this, I got really depressed, to the point where my mom got scared and said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.” I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, “Nah, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!” I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabby “Yo holmes, smell ya later!” Looked at my kingdom I was finally there; to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
