message=I saw this cute guy at the top of the stairs to the Mathews Theatres on Thursday afternoon at like 3? He was kicking a small soccer-esque ball but it was the size of a tennis ball. I thought he looked really hot when he was smiling. He was with his friend. Like daaaaaayum smile some more, but smile at meeeeeeeeeee
