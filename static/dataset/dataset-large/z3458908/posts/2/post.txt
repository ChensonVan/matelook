message=To all the good looking ladies on campus, single or taken (I won't discriminate). I am who you are looking for. I am as close as they come to being the perfect specimen of a male with all the virtues you seek summed up in two words: complete awsomeness. If you find me your life will be fulfilled. I am everything you could ever want. I am also modest and in no way full of myself. So come and find me. I'm waiting PS: To any guy who tries to claim that he wrote this. No. You're wrong. You're not me. Only I am me. Have a good day
