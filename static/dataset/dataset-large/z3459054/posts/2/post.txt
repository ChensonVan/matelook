message=I've liked this girl for around 2 years now and I still don't have the courage to ask her out. She's my friend but I'm not content to be friends with her anymore. I've suppressed my feelings for her for the majority of the 2 years because she's been in a relationship and she hasn't been over past boyfriends. She's recently broken up and is single but I still don't have the guts to do it. How do I approach this because I don't wanna make our friendship awkward because of my feelings?
