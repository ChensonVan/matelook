message=To that cute girl in MATH1151 who's name starts with J,\n\nYou are the most beautiful person I have ever seen and your sparkling eyes just light up my whole world. I come to classes just to see you. Every time your friend snapchat's a picture of you, my heart goes wild. But you never give me any attention and I'm too shy to confront you. I sent you a picture saying that i can see you but you didn't reply. I'm sorry if you thought I was creepy but I'm in love and i don't know how to say it. \n\nLove you
