message=To the cute boy with thick glasses in my MATH1151 lecture (people call you Alex but others call you Greg so I'm not sure), I keep hearing your friends joking about how you're trying to find a girlfriend. If they're not joking and you can't find the perfect girl, I'd like to be your boyfriend? Just give me a chance
