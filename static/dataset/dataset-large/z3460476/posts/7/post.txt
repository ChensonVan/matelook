message=To the girl who took the train arriving to Central at ~10 AM last Tuesday, whom I sat next to on the train with, I just want to say you looked so pretty but I was too shy to talk to you or introduce myself. If I see you again, I'll say hi this time.\n\n~Shy guy who wanted to share an umbrella with you
