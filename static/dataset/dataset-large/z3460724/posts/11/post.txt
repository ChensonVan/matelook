message=As a first year international student, its hard for me to meet girls who are Australian. So today I was in the library and I saw a girl sitting by herself. So I sat down next to her and said 'Do you speak my language?'. She just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich. Do all Aussie Girls do this?
