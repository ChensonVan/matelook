message=To the two Sri Lankan girls who live at UniLodge, I think you'll were at the Sri Lankan Stall at Artsweek. My friend and I saw you from across the quad, and seeing you two laugh uncontrollably together brightened up our day. We think youâ€™re really cute, double date sometime? ;) ;)\n\nFrom, \nTwo mesmerised mystery guys from UniLodge
