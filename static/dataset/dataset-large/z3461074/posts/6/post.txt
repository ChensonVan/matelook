message=Dear Bo Yeung? Yang? anyway that is besides the point. You have this nice bubbly vibe around you and your fashion sense is on point (I see your shoes you wear and they're amazing <3) Can we hang out some time please? I really am captured by your kindness and sense of humour.\n\n-Girl who hangs out too much near stellini's pasta and sees you around a lot
