message=To the Pomeranian that was in front of Matthews lecture theatre, you were so cute and fluffy I wanted to tear up but I was with a friend and I didn't want them to think I was crazy. Still sad that I didn't get to boop your head. Keep being a princess/prince and make your owner carry you when you're tired.
