message=Dear white girls,\n\nAs an asian boy from the western suburbs of Sydney, I've noticed a recurring theme with couples not only at UNSW, but in the general city area. Theres plenty of caucasian couples, and theres more than enough asian couples. But the main thing I see are caucasian male/asian female couples. I'm not saying that its bad, they're all so cute and they're bound to make beautiful halfie children if they ever decide to take it that far.\n\nBut what I want to bring up, is why have I only seen five caucasian female/asian male couples??? Surely the should be a balance right? It has made trying to pick up girls a lot harder since a lot of white girls wont give me a chance, and they'll only see me as a friend or merely an acquaintance. So I'd like to ask, what is it about asian guys that white girls, and, most other females over other races find unappealing about asian males? Is it the stereotype that is off-putting? There's actually quite a few 'pretty boy' asians on campus like a friend of mine, but he also finds trying to maintain a conversation with a white girl difficult.\n\nPls respond
