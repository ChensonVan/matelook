message=Ever since I laid eyes on you, I couldn't wait to get on top of you, and once I did, I felt so amazing. Every time I'm finished with you, I get so sweaty, but it's so worth it. I haven't seen the likes of you in any other university before, and I don't think there's anybody quite like you.\n\nI love you, UNSW Stairs.
