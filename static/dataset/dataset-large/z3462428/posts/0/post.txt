message=To the white Actuarial guy at Law Ball,\n\nDamn you had some sick df moves and were looking sexy af. I tried to get a photo with you but I think you were more interested in the df. I thought all Actuarial people were meant to be boring but you fit right in with the Law crew. Hopefully we bump into each other at uni some time.\n\nP.s. why were you even at Law Ball?
