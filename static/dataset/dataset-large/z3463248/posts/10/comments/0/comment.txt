message=Dear z5019329,\n\nThe last time I saw you, you were in a medicine lab at the back watching Olympics on your laptop. You were wearing black tracksuit pants, thongs, and an unwashed rugby jersey. You have been my inspiration, fuelling my passion and lust for anything that distracts me from my studies. \n\nI only hope that one day you will be as lost in my eyes as you are in medicine exams. You make me feel young again. \n\nLove, z5011849. \n\nP.S. Rose was to nervous to post this herself
