message=To the girl that helped me find the bathroom in Matthews ages ago. You were waiting on the couch for your tutorial at around 11:30-12 on a friday and when I came back I said thank you but you were talking to your friend and I had to go back into my tute so I couldn't stay and chat. You were really cute, brown hair with blonde at the end and wearing a unsw hoodie and glasses I think? I regret not asking your name. Hopefully i see you around, but if not...coffee sometime?
