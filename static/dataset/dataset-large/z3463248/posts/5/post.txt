message=To Henry P in first year MATH1151\n\nI find you very cute everytime you smile, because that makes my heart skip a beat. Whenever you stretch I can see your shirt stretch too. You always hang with that boy and that makes me extremely jealous because I can never approach you. Ditch him next time and I'll sit with you
