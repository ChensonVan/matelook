message=Moh Moh Win\n\nIf you ever feel broken, I will pick up the pieces and glue them together. I will run my fingers along those discordant boundaries until they leave no traces of unevenness. If you ever feel torn, I promise I will sew you up; beautifully. And if I ever see you sinking down the dark abyss of your past, I promise you I will follow you and crawl right in. Even if we fail to find an escape; at least, we will be together forever. That is all that matters.
