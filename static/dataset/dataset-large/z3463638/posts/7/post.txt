message=To my Medical girl\nI'm so into you and I can't confess to you. Every night, I text "I Love You" to you with my phone in air-plane mode so the text can never get to you and our friendship won't change. The other night, I did the same thing and forgot to switch to air-plane mode and you may have read that text. And now, I don't have guts to text or even talk to you. Please don't let my stupid action change who you are. Your you is why I love you. I don't mind if you hate me or scared of me forever but you will always be in my heart. I LOVE YOU Q
