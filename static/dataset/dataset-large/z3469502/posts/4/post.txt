message=Dear the cute asian girl from Construction Management and Property,\n\nI've been watching you from a few rows back in most classes. If I don't see you, I'll sit by the door just to catch a glimpse of your beauty as you walk by.\n\nI always see you sit with a whole group of people so I'm too scared to talk to you. \n\nI think you're really pretty and you always dress really cute. I was wondering if you are single, cause if you are, I'm ready to mingle.\n\nI'd let you onto my construction site, but be careful, my bomb might go off.\n\nIf you become my girl, I'll fill in all your cracks ;)\n\nFrom the guy sitting behind you (I swear i'm not creepy)
