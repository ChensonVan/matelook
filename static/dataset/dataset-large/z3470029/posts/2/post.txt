message=To Des from ARTS2751. You are one of the most attractive guys ever. I can barely concentrate and put an argument together in our class debates when you are sitting near me. \nWhat is your story? Are you single, taken. \n\nEither way when are you free for coffee. If you get tagged on this post and let me know whether you are single or not. I'll gain the courage to ask you out. \n\nUntil then ;)
