message=To FD,\nYou are the best thing that has ever happened to me. From the time that you brought a crocodile to the Village Green, and when you brought an elephant to the top of the clock tower at the Quadrangle, life has just never been the same. You bring me so much entertainment, food and the best vibe when I'm around. Although I only see you once a year (you were so gorgeous at the Fiesta last year), it's the best damn day ever! I love that you put on an ace scavenger hunt too where you make all these students do the most embarrassing things ever (I know you love to watch it secretly). I'll see you next week at the Colour Run at uni babe. <3\n\nWintendo
