message=To Jeffrey Cheung...You seemed to be a nice guy at first sight, but turns out what I thought was surely not right. The thought of you once gave me butterflies, but now I’d rather think of other better-looking guys. I used to dream about being your only chick, but now the thought of it makes me very sick. Your ego is too big, so in conclusion you’re not the type of guy I'll ever want to dig\nxoxo W.C
