message=Llamas, llamas, llamas\nThat is the nickname of the love of my life- llama. And as weird as that may sound, I have been with her for 4 years and i am quite sure that she is the one. When I first met her, I kept forgetting her name- Was it Meghna???or Megana? or Megan?- I wasn't quite sure. But now, with her current nickname, i don't need to worry about pronouncing her name wrong. Llama is beautiful and smart, and I know she would succeed in life just like every llama should. Her greetings make me feel bright and ready for a new day, just like llamas (spit on people's faces as a greeting). Llama would you see this cool alpaca, and realise that it could be your husband.... \n\nxxoo, ily llama
