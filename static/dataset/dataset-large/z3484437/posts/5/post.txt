message=To the boy that sits with his Kensington college friends in all the medicine lectures - I think your name starts with L? You are so sexy and I want to do bad things to you in the anatomy labs after hours. I would love to wipe your "lazy, worthless snotty nose" and I think you look mighty fine in those fine suits sipping champagne. I don't care if you're "capable of empathy and compassion", I just hope you're capable in other areas ;)
