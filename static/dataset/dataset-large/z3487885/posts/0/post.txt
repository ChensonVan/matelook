message=To the Asian girl wearing a cream/peach crop top and black framed glasses in the physics lecture on Wednesday 3 weeks ago who dropped her phone on the way out of the lecture... I just wanted to say that I have never seen such an elegant beauty in my entire life... When I handed you your phone back and our eyes met, I felt electricity fly between us... Something I had never experienced before... If you felt the same spark I'd love to take you to take you out sometime... I haven't been able to stop thinking about you... so what do you say? Coffee? ;)
