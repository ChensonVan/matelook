message=I've heard some rather alternative names in my time at UNSW, however there was one I heard which has forever been on my mind. I wouldn't know exactly how it's spelt, but it sounds a like knee hill. When I first heard it last year in the law library, I turned in surprise and there I spotted a rather strapping man. About a fortnight ago on a Wednesday afternoon I spotted you, looking very suave in a suit and it just took my breath away. So knee hill (or however its spelt), come out from wherever you are (:
