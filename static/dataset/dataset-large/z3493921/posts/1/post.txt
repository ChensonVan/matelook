message=No face, No FB, no number, when will you stop hiding from me? Nicole\n\nIt’s been more than a year now and I’ve thought I can forget you and move on, but the fact is, I can’t. The more I try to forget you, the more I miss you. That feelings is just like a toxic, kind of cocaine, it’s nibbling my soul days by days, seconds by seconds. Let you go is really the biggest mistake of my life and I will do whatever it takes to get you back. \n\nI don’t think you can see these lines but, still, I wish there’s magic out there that brings you back just like how it happened when we first met. \n\nMy ego was so big to hold you back that time and that made me a dumbass. \n\nI don’t know what was happening among us that made you were so angry the last time we talked but if I was an asshole, just spit it at my face and then tell me what I did wrong because, really, I didn’t mean to be an asshole. I know it would be greedy to ask you for another chance but I’ll just be greedy this time only. So, angel, give me one more chance!!!
