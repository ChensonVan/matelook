message=To the tall, thin and gorgeous Sri Lanken girl that was in my Design lab last semester. I have always envious of the twenty guys that always accompanied your presence. I would like to put my micro farad into your characteristic curve and fully excite your field. I dream of setting you on ground potential, raising your frequency and lowering your resistance. One day I long to insert it in parallel and short circuit your shunt. I hope to oscillate with you happily ever after.
