message=Today i was in a group meeting (like every monday), and i was talking to one of my team mates and i told him i was a gamer, he responded "wow, you do law, you are a gamer, you're unbelievably pretty, you're incredbly funny and have a great personality, guys must be begging to go out with you" (also just in case anyone was wondering, he already is in a relationship). But the truth is, no guy has never confessed to me or asked me out before. What am I doing wrong? Ive confessed to guys before and they always say "sorry but i dont think of you in that way".
