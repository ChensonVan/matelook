message=Dear Zara?? (My friends said that was your name but im not sure…) \n\nMy heart skipped a beat when I saw you on the dance floor at arts ball. Like my night hadn’t been going the best up till then but I couldn’t help smiling knowing there was such a beautiful girl at the ball. I wanted to approach you but you kept dancing with your boyfriend. I think he had a blue bow tie? I was a bit put out but he must be a lucky man to have caught your heart! He is definitely punching above his weight. You guys seemed to have a lot of fun together tho, which made me really happy. At least you did with all your dancing. I wish I could have met you that night, seen that smile up close. Even being your friend would be super cool. Maybe next time?\n\nYour biggest fan that night, \nThe girl in the red dress.
