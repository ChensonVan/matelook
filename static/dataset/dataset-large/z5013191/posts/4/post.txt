message=To the Arc Street Teamer who is short, cute and bubbly, Asian of some kind - maybe Indo? - I think your name sounds like Lisa? I have seen you now quite a few times and can't stop thinking about your smile. I've spotted you a couple of times in the law building too, and hope you are doing law so that you can teach me all about how to get out of trouble... if you know what i mean ;) I'm a fellow law student, and may be some time we could get Litt Up (hoping you watch Suits so you'll get the reference.) Hoping I run into you again, maybe I'll have the courage to say hello, if I'm not too court up in your beauty (pun intended). This could be the start of something great. Love and admiration, from your Harvey Specter.
