message=Dear Denny,\n\nAs I woke up from a cold night in the arms of a handsome, ‘large boned’, masquerade model. Your lips were indescribable, it was a heaven-like feeling when your tongue slithered onto mine. My mum was right, “If your man is not long enough, he will always be able to compensate somewhere else”. Even though I’m not worth a crashed Porshe, or $100 ear rings. I am definitely in more than a zone with you, I’m in love. Chatswood has never been as wild, my sweet Tarzan. As the moonlight uncovers your room, your UBS cadetship badge catches my eyes. Your whitening teeth shines bright like a diamond, which strikes an epiphany back to a few hours earlier where you were unleashing your 80’s dance moves all over me. At that moment, I just wanted to ask if “you wanna hang with me?” but as the night grew on me, your persistency and unique ways of flirting has taken over me. Your pickup line which I’ll never forget, “when my cadets are popping molly, the only thing that pops for me are images of your cute face”. That melted my heart, now at this moment of time I was ready to get down and go ahead and get down. I’m forever yours.\n\nAnione Jaysie Elayne
