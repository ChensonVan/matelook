message=To Brenda Mowsing (I dont know if thats how you spell it) in my ARTS1810 IR lecture,\n\nYou are the most prettiest girl I have ever laid my eyes on. You make my heart flutter and  tingle like how butterflies fly into the horizon. Your eyes are like jewels, glistening even under rainy days. I walk into the lecture wanting to sit next to you every time but I can never work up the courage to do so. I hope one day you will notice me glancing your way.
