message=To the gorgeous burmese girl who studies commerce at UNSW. All I can say is you are the prettiest girl I have ever met in my whole life! I think your nickname is "Toto" or at least thats what I have heard your friends call you. I just wanted to ask if you ever wanted to grab some lunch sometime? I know you love the halal thai place because thats where I first saw you. If your up for it meet me on Monday 11 am outside the library. Look forward to seeing you\nXOXO your lover. I love you Towheda Ahmed!
