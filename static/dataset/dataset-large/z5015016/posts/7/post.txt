message=Every Wednesday I look forward to my Econ 1101 tutorial. I look forward forward to sitting in class and seeing this cute boy named naeem.\nYou stare into the oblivion as I stare into your eyes. You smile at your friend's joke as I smile at you. I'm always too scared to approach you;\nso if you or your friends read this, the girl with the black top, tied  up hair and anxious look is me :) <3
