message=Dear heartless person,\n\nHow dare you try and degrade my girl in such a way. Without her, I wouldn't be in the position i'm in at uni. It's a privilege to have such a sweet and interesting girlfriend. Do you honestly think I care about your deans awards...do you run one of the worlds top solar car teams...I don't think so. I think i'm dating the right girl and I love her.\n\nThanks but no thanks. \n\nRegards,\n\nDanny
