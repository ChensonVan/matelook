message=I find it so sad that I am a lonely guy in UNSW. I mean where are all the girls at? I try my best to be nice to all the girls but I keep getting friendzoned. Seriously, I feel like Tasmania, the little state that everyone forgets because it is not buff enough compared to the chad mainland Australia. Seriously, I mean I might not look at hot as Dudley Dursley but I still have a good heart. Just give me a chance, stop judging me from the outside. I can be the best romantic lover you ever had and I am not like those chads who only has muscles to show.
