message=To that funny pretty European looking girl  that ordered the acai bowl at Bar Navitas near Anzac Parade,\nI see the way your friends cheer for you when you enter the building. Your smile lights up any room. Your voice radiates through my soul, like a soundtrack to my love. Sometimes I listen, I think you once caught me laughing. Your gleaming eyes are a vision that can't escape my dreams and fantasies.\nYour name, I can't catch, something like Stafsat??\nLet me be the clap to your entrance. \nCome find me, I'll be waiting for you. Can't wait to acee you.
