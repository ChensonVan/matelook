message=To my dear Hasi,\n\nI really hope that you read this letter. I know you have been very angry with me of late, which is why I really want to make it up to you. I apologise for anything that I have done which has annoyed you but I only do it because of my feelings for you. I realize my faults and I am writing in the desire to make amends. I sincerely hope that you can forgive me and we can carry on being friends. I'm sorry I had to communicate this way to you because you didn't want to see me in person. I'm sure you know who this is.
