message=I’m a year one student and this is a shout out to a girl, another year one student I met at a research study a few weeks back. She’s tall, of Caucasian, Chinese descent and gorgeous beyond measure. We share a similar lecture on Tuesday morning. I’ve… fallen in love with you. And I know my love is true, for nothing can take my mind off of you. My heart races, goes aflutter whenever I see you and the moments where I wait for you to walk into the lecture hall are the moments that I love and dread, anxiety pounding deep within my chest. An force of nature unequalled, threatening to tear me in two. I conjure an event weeks ago. The way the sun shines through your hair bleaching it a fiery reddish brown, the way it billows light as a feather behind you as you walk. That familiar face with those lovely delicate features, soft eyes revealing a kinder, demure personality. I replay those moments in my head over and over again. Capturing that joyous moment, but oh how my heart races. I long to see you again. I long to make you mine and I yours. To share my days with you, its joys and sorrows. Some might say why do I not approach you? But I fear that approaching you might frighten you, for you seem too delicate for the games most people play. Do you look at me as I do you I wonder? I imagine but dare not hope. If you do recognise who I am and you are willing, I beseech you to give a sign. For my heart is yours and yours alone. And my love is earnest, strong and true. And even if you love another, my heart is content, for you have given me the greatest gift of all, a chance to love you.
