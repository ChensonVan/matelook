message=To the girl who has borrowed my washing powder since the beginning of time and the nights I spent escorting you to maccas, I have always relished the opportunity of being close to you. Ever since you came back to my room to take your shoe rack back, I have missed your daily trips to my room, putting those amazing looking thongs on those pristine racks. Not having you near me these days have been intensely tormenting. Life has been bleak, tasteless, meaningless. You have been the light of my life, but alas, the distance has come between us. I just want you to know that I love you deeply and want you back in my life.\n\nSincerely,\nYour forlorn secret admirer
