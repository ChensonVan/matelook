message=So I saw this really cute guy driving in a 2015 White Jep Wrangler (yes I know my cars) down Anzac Pde on Monday afternoon around 4:30. Think his license plate was 96NATE. I have no idea if he's even from UNSW but if he is I just wanted to say he was pretty cute and handsome looking from where I was sitting on the bus.
