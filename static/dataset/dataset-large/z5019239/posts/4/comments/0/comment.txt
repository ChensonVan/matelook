message=i was unaware that the definition of a good girl cannot be someone who appreciates music, drinks alcohol, experiences sexuality, or wears jeans at botanic gardens. \ncompletely understand the definition though. who doesnt like those loud obnoxious customers screaming their lungs off at a restaurant.\n\nand you say you want a girl that knows her worth yet you already categorising them as good or bad? nice play
