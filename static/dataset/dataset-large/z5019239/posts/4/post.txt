message=Are there any good girls out there? \n\nThe ones that don't do drugs, don't go to raves, don't hook up. \nThe ones you'd see reading books on buses or exploring art exhibitions;\nThe ones you'd see wearing a floral dress at the botanic gardens;\nThe ones you'd see laughing across the restaurant with all her girlfriends.\n\nThe ones that don't settle for less and knows her worth.\nThe ones you'd see helping out strangers on the streets;\nThe ones you'd see playing with dogs and not with hearts;\nThe ones you'd see chasing their dreams and not the boys.\n\nAre there any good girls out there?\n\nTag that girl that deserves only the best :)
