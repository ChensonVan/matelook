message=To Ching (I finally figured out what your friends called you), I'm the girl from #12988\n\nI saw your friends tagging you in the previous post, so I definitely know I got the right person. I even went out of my way to tell you what I was wearing but you just left me in the lecture room with a racing heart. I wished you did say hi. \n\nYou didn't come to the lecture this week and I have to admit I was kind of disappointed. It's come to a point where I only go to the lecture to see you and daydream about the possibilities which could happen between us.\n\nIf possible, do you think we can meet up in the mid-semester break for a movie or lunch?  Since we won't have any lectures for now, I guess.. if you comment on this post, I'll take initiative and message you instead.  \n\nFrom the same shy Asian girl who is still noticing you.
