message=I've seen you with another guy, but my love for you is too strong. You're long black straight hair is as sharp as needles when it stabs my heart in my deepest dreams. Anne Alminaza, your fashion sense takes my breath away, and although there is not much to cloth, you work it like I work my ox on my farm, and how I'm going to work you in my bed.\n\nI've had three crushes since I've began uni, but so far you take the cake because you are my cake. Because I'll eat you like a cake, and we can make little cupcakes.\n\nAnnonymous guy from your elec class xx
