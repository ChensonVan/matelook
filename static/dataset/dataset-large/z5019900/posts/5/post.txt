message=Dear uni peers,\nI am a straight guy (yay for me), but everytime I see mentions of transgender people it gets me thinking. I know Australia, relative to the US probably has a lower proportion of trans people, and I haven't started dating yet (life is hard), but I keep worrying that one day I'll find a girl, who's really a guy. You might get angry cause I don't acknowledge them as their "current" gender, but has changing their external appearance really made them the other gender? That's not what I'm here to ask. For the people who are brave enough to answer,  what would you do if you found out the person you're dating is a transexual person? Some may say they're the same on the inside, but unless they told you at the start of the relationship, they've really been witholding this information from you since you met them. It's technically not a lie, but then again if you cheat on your bf/gf you're  not lying to them about cheating if they've never asked you.\n\nPeople couple the community of lesbians and gays with transgender people, but if a lesbian or gay person likes you, you know they're lesbian or gay because they're the same sex as you.
