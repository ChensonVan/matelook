message=To the asian girl who wears black and white superstars in my Tuesday ECON1203 Lecture. \n\nEvery time I sneak a glance at you I can't help but stare at your beautiful brown/ombre hair. Is the guy you sit next to during the lecture your boyfriend? I would love to get to know you and become your friend. If you're interested, please send me a reply in the form of a message on this post or an online anonymous reply.\n\nSincerely, \n\nA lonely asian guy in your lecture.
