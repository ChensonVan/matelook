message=A lot of people in relationships, short or long term, fail to understand that a person does come with flaws and will make mistakes. Nobody is a saint. Not even a saint... but that's besides the point. Be accepting, arguments happen, things sometimes don't go your way, learn to compromise. A relationship is about ups and downs, and it's also a learning experience, making you and your SO better people. A happy relationship will only be if both parties are willing to invest.
