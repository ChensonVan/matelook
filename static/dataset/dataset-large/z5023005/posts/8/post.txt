message=To my Macroeconomics Lecturer every Monday and Wednesday: Whenever I see your sweater and collared shirt combination in our lectures I can't help but to feel chomosexual lust come over me. Your muscle definition is impeccable and your pecs hard and firm no doubt like the heat betwixt your loins. You are the apple of my eye, the fire between my thighs and my angel in the sky. Even down to your boneriffic accent and your typical Korean glasses, you are the very embodiment of an Asian adonis. Your gaze burns with desire, I can see it, but I have been too shy thus far to ask for coffee. I'm too caught up in the outlines of your washboard abs through your sweater to pay attention to you in lectures. I only wish you would pay more attention to me. My body yearns and aches for you - there is nothing nominal about our love, it is all real.
