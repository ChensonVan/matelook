message=This is less of a love letter and more of a sad love poem. To all those who are sad, and melancholy in love.\n\nI loved you, your smile, your quiet strength.\nThe way you cared for others, your personality's depth.\nI gave you my everything, and yet it was not enough.\nThe way our lives clashed, was just too rough.\n\nThrough turbulent days and nights we sailed,\nAgainst each other's feelings we railed.\nAnd yet though we said bye,\nI still can't let myself cry.\n\nI'll love you forever, you'll always be my first one.\nEven if I move on to other girls, even if I find the one.\nSomewhere, over the rainbow, in another world,\nA life together, a flag of happiness unfurls.\n\nBut.\nThat life is not here.\nAnd I face the empty world, full of fear.\n\nMy wall full of memories and stories,\nIs once again bare, nothing, no glories.\n\nStill I feel and see,\nYour face, your breath on the breeze.\nSo until that very day I die, \nI will soar with you through the sky.
