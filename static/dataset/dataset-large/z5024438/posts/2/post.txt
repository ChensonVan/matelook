message=To the Black and White Duo,\n\nIt's been a while but I'm back, so no need to miss me anymore. I was just wondering if I could have you two as my dates for ASOC Ball? I honestly cannot think of anyone who is more attractive than you two that studies ACTL. Just imagine we could be a Black, White and Yellow Trio that would be the hottest thing that's happened at UNSW.\n\nCute Asian Girls Who's Gonna Win You Over
