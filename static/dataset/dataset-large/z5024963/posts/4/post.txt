message=To my classmate that i admire, it was nice seeing and talking to you today. Sorry if I am quite reserved, I am just too shy. I liked it when you touched me. I wish I would have the courage and confidence to hold you too. Looking forward seeing you on Monday and best of luck on our exam. I am sure you'll know who I am if you got the chance to read this letter. :-)
