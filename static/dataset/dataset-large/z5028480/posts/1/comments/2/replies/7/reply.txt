message=An average class is about 25-30 anyway, less for seniors. Having learning disability is one thing, not bring their school bags and you spend your a lot of time writing incident reports on truanting and bullying are another. The point is you'll have a lot other responsibilities as a school teacher. I worked in a coaching centre for a year, full time. I had variation of kids coming to the centre too. So I know what you're talking about. But it is different.
