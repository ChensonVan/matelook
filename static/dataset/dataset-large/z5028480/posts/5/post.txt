message=So this never happens to me, but on Tuesday the 5th of April in the library (level 2 computers) at around 3pm, there was this really cute guy wearing a maroon shirt that said ULLHC (something about Ladies Hockey). He had light brown hair with gold highlights and he was eating (rebel!).\n\nAnyway, it's so unlikely that you're single, so just know that you are cute and you should feel cute. I hope you aced the test you were studying for :)
