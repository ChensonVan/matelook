message=Bright as red,\nDark as maroon,\nWith a stem to tick it up,\nAs sweet as a sugar cube.\n\nThe first lick off the peel,\nThe first touch, the first feel,\nMy lips, her skin,\nShe tasted sweet, she made me kneel.\n\nI grabbed her body too tight,\nTo never let her go away,\nShe kept bleeding all the while,\nPushing herself from me to runaway.\n\nI broke down,\nShe threw her crown,\nI let her loose,\nI let myself frown.\n\nI pressed my fingers on her,\nMy thumb numbed her bottom.\nShe screamed in pleasure,\nAnd we made love once again to treasure.\n\nI bit a bit of her,\nShe had that beautiful lip mark.\nIt was when she gave me that sensational look,\nThat blew my head off the spark!\n\nI made love till I bit her bone,\nI ripped her clothes till it was torn.\nShe kissed me hard till we made out,\nI pushed in too hard till she 'ouched' to shout.\n\nWhat a beautiful night it was,\nWhen our love rose to the peak,\nShe was changing,\nand I got to sneak,\nShe turned her back,\nand I fell down yet too weak.\n\nI miss being in love,\nWith a soul to cherish for life,\nHow hot, how pretty she was,\nI wish that 'CHERRY' was really my wife! ;) <3
