message=I've been keeping this in for a long time, but ever since I first heard you talking to your friend in our MATH1131 lecture way back in first year, I haven't been able to get you out of my head. Your voice is almost as smooth as the ride I wanna give you. \nYour voice makes me moist.\nHit me up on campus, or anywhere else in Sidney ;)\n\nxx
