message=There's a girl who works at the ARC reception. She's so beautiful. I need to know who she is. She has long black hair, she's brown (not sure where she's from) and she was wearing a red skull necklace when I saw her. I also saw her take a bus to La Perouse. I think I've made it pretty clear, so someone please tell me who she is. I'm obsessed :(
