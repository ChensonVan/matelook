message=Peter Ambados, In our construction management lectures I can't help but find myself randomly staring at you, I begin to blush sometimes when I realise that I am or when you look back at me. I don't know why I find you so cute and attractive even though you are weird, emo and wear lots of gucci but it works for me. If you read this I think you will know who this is, so would you like to get a drink with a girl like me Peter? xoxo
