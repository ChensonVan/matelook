message=I love you, even if you are religious and patronising! Forever yours, Broken-Hearted. The question is can you love a non-believer? I believe our love transcends the heavens and I love you for your personality and nothing else! Why must the religious values question be such a big deal?! You clearly don't love me enough to look past that. I see it as a betrayal. I wanted to believe in you. </3
