message=Anonymous, you're no longer a child\nI do not doubt you mean it well\nBut now there is a higher call!\nWho cares about your lonely soul\nWe strive toward a larger goal\nOur little lives don't count at all!\nRed, the ink of angry pens\nBlack, the hue of subjects passed.\nRed, with which my eyes are drawn\nBlack, the drink that breaks my fast!
