message=To the guy in the patterned shirt who looks a bit like Eddie Redmayne in my ARTS1010 lecture. I've been on my own for a while, but let me tell you - I would climb you like a barricade. We should totally let the wine go to our brains and have some 2460-fun, until there's nothing but us and empty chairs at empty tables. Drink with me?
