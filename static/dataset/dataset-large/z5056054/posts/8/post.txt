message=To Matthew Ching. Wish I could turn back time and rewind back to climbing Everest. I should've asked u out back then but I don't think I'm your type lol. But even so, I wish we could have become closer. Hope you don't have a gf yet but if you do have a gf I will legitimately move on with my life and get over u completely. Just say the word XD\n\nLove From your secret admirer xx
