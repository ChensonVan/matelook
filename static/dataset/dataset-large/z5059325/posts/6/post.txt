message=To the pretty asian lady in black dress at matsoc/ceus cruise party whom i asked to use the mixed cubicle first during tough times, thank you for your kindess. I forgot to ask for your name nor invite you for a drink, but seeing your cute smile is what makes me high all night, something i cannot possibly achieve through the unlimited alcohol alone. I hope you are going to UNSW and, if possible, how does lunch/ coffee/ milktea on me sound the next time we meet? \nSincerely, \nShy guy with orange whiskers and spikey hair :)
