message=To the asian girl that used to go Unigym last year, who wears the green singlet, black shorts and pink freeruns, had a black ponytail, I was too shy to start a conversation but really liked you, i helped you unrack the weights on the squat rack and you always do the assisted pullups. You used to workout with a friend of yours but couple of times last year i saw you, you were working out solo. I haven't seen you in gym in a long time, and maybe you can come back?
