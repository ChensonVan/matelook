message=To I saw you in the GENL1021-World Religions lecture this week and you're really cute. You have weird curly hair and you have some purple or pink in there as well.\n\nYou also have a weird voice that sounds gay-ish in which I hope isn't the case.\n\nYou always stare at me for some reason so I assume that you must like me or something?\n\nI honestly haven't been with a guy in so long and I think that you would make a nice boyfriend. We can have sex if you want? I'm actually horny.\n\nI'm 21 just in case you wanted to know. I don't exactly know how old you are though.\n\nIf you want to message me, please do. Just message me your name and stuff as I don't know your name and if you would like to meet up sometime.\n\n0414437457.
