message=Dear AS,\n\nFrom the first time I saw you in central park, my heart stop beating for a while cos of your perfection.\nTurns out that we are in the same class and start hanging out with each other almost every week.\nWhenever I look into your eyes, i feel paralysed.\nYour smile always remain in my head before I go to sleep and your smell always remain in my car (that's why i never wash my car)\nI don't know why my brain is always stop working whenever i talked to you, but just by looking into your eyes, I feel relaxed.\n\nI just want to let you know that I love you and I wanna be with you\n\nSadly, you already have a boyfriend, so you will never know how much I love you :(\n\nS.W.
