message=Depression and anxiety are honestly hard to get over. It's frustrating and (at times) painful to live through. And since there's no physical scars, it's hard to know when it will end. I (nor anyone else) can promise you it will get better, but I can tell you that you're not alone. I can't tell you what to do (because different things work for different people), but I can tell you (as someone who is battling depression and anxiety myself) that it helps to be kind to yourself. Know that you are doing the best you can. Praise yourself when you accomplish even the smallest things (like getting out of bed, doing a presentation in front of people, etc). Because they're honestly not easy for everyone... And be honest with yourself. If you feel like you need a break from uni or other things in your life, then do it. There's no need to beat yourself up for things that are out of your control. And you know yourself best after all.\n\nThe only advice I can give you is - If you know someone you can trust (whether it be a friend, family member, etc), please reach out to them. Sometimes letting it all out can be a big relief and makes it easier to know where to go/what to do from there. I know it certainly did for me. \n\nI hope things will get better for you soon.
