message=Hi there, First of all - I'm so proud of you for reaching out. It's one of the most difficult things to do, and you've made the very first step. I have found that it's not so much 'getting over' depression, but as you get older, you learn how to cope with the nuances of your condition - from workload to how you interact with people. \n\nGetting proper therapy can be difficult if you don't know what to expect. Having a chat with someone who's been through it, and has come out a stronger person, can help you to get you started with finding and accessing professional help. If you'd like, I'm happy to chat over PM. \n\nStay strong, you're on the way there <3
