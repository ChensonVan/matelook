message=Yes it is possible to get over depression. Some people have recurring episodes, many have just one or two in their lives. Getting older is a huge relief, in my opinion.\n\nSome things that can help make depression/anxiety a rare event, not a chronic issue, include getting all the support you can. As others have mentioned, the GPs on campus are great, use the psych service and make lifestyle changes like joining a team, get daily exercise, sleep a regular 8hrs a night, eat fresh fruit and veggies, cut out the alcohol and junk food, take up yoga/meditation, go walking in nature (beach, park, national forest), find some form of art/music/self-expression that transports you into a state of 'flow', take an online support course (links below) and explore what spirituality means for you. \n\nHit it from all angles and see what works for you. People need to feel connected, in some control and worthwhile, and depression and anxiety cut us off from those very things. \n\nhttps://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome\n\nhttps://thiswayup.org.au/
