message=To the President of the UN society,\nI have an international dilEmma at hand,\nno it's not Syria or war in Sudan.\nI've sent my problem to the WTO,\nbut problem solving is not something they know.\nMy problem is I'm in love with you,\nmy heart has overtaken my brain in a military coup.\nYou're so beautiful that UNESCO has named you a sight,\nwith your leadership even the UN seems alright.\nStay the president forever, you always have my signature,\ntogether we can even pass it through the Legislature.\nYou are the smartest diplomat I've ever heard or seen,\nmy right of national reply is "Stop it already I'm super keen".\nEmma I may not MUN anymore, but for your love I'll take it to the floor.\nMy draft resolution reads that you are advised,\nto review each day your beautiful eyes.\nPlease don't reject my position paper on you,\notherwise this delegate will be broken in two.\nYou better pass some internet resolutions to find who am I,\nor contact your local all-knowing NSA spy.\nLove from Anonymous
