message=To the boy who used to shave his head and now has blonde short hair and sometimes wears black nail polish, this is the first semester you haven't been in one of my classes (BA maj. english but we had heaps of creative writing courses together) for three years and i miss having you around, but i don't even know your name. If you see me sometime i'm sure you'll know it's me, please say hello and stop and chat with me. You're probably too cool to have facebook though so i doubt you'll see this and i feel like a major looser for going to such a lame extreme. Yours forever more, the girl with sometimes curly hair.
