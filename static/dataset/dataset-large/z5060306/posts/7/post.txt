message=To UNSW Foundation day,\nThat night we spent together last year was a whirlwind of passion and steamy lovemaking. But alas, I awoke to an empty bed and an angry hangover. The past year I have been sojourn here at the university, alone and paley loitering. The sedge withered from the village green, and no birds sing. Perhaps this year we can rekindle our fleeting romance?\nYour One Time Lover,\nThe Human Enchilada
