message=To a certain unsw-er\nIs it mean of me to watch your desperation unfold, with you making facebook accounts to like your own statuses, activities and create wallposts? Is it wrong of me to look down on your ability to say no to desperate clingy exes who cheat on you? I am oh so tempted to tell your borderline personality ex, that she needs azithromycin before she gets infertile, but maybe its as you suggest- its better for the world that this creature doesn't reproduce.
