message=The 10min journey from uni to alexandria was 10min of pure hell. It was a challenge greater than licking both elbows simultaneously. I sat down next to Satan himself and immediately was punched in the face by the toxic smell of what seemed to be Lynx Africa or the likes. You know what I'm talking about, the pungent smell that burns your nose and gives you lung cancer. Too polite to get up and move (there were no othwr seats) I began to control my breaths, reducing the average 15 breaths per minute to 1 breath per minute. I almost died. But tbh I would have died either way. Point is, can someone please explain why men soak their clothes and body in that terminal cancer causing scent. What is the appeal? Or is it just me that has an adverse reaction to such filth.  Please I don't understand. I just got off the bus and is recovering like a tourist who has just drowned at Bondi beach. Where's the Bondi Rescue at? More like Lynx Rescue.
