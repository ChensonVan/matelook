message=To the Korean girl doing 2nd year Psychology courses,\nI saw you at the psyc2061 and 2001 exams. Hearing you speak Korean to your friend blew my mind. I don't know your name and I don't know if you can speak English well but I just wanted to let you know that 너 너무 예쁘다. If you were the girl that kept saying 빨리 빨리 on the bus to the 2061 exam, then I'm talking about you.
