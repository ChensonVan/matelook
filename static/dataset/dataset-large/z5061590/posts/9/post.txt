message=I know this is completely inappropriate but Joel, you broke my heart. We bumped into each other yesterday and I could tell that you can't rememberâ€¦or you don't want to remember. Roundhouse? Foundation Day party? Us? and then yesterday I saw you with this cute COFA student (I know one when I see one) flirting. what is it with COFA students? I mean, there must be something that sets them apart from "us"! it hurts you know. but if that's your happiness, I'm willing to set you free. You were NEVER mine on the first place. see yah when I see yah. -JER
