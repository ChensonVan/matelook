message=To this brown girl who is a study abroad student here, \n\nI have talked to you so many times but can't ever get your name, but you are so cute! You're such a positive girl and always full of life, making others around you happy too. That cheerful, shining smile is to die for! Stay the same and keep in touch. We will meet soon ;)\n \nPS: I will learn to pronounce your name by then, I promise ;)
