message=Dear Nadz of post #12676.\n\nI woke up on Tuesday morning feeling dejected, but when I saw the endearing comments on UNSW Love letters, my face beamed with such a joy I've never experienced. Suddenly you injected life into me. I'll be frank, this is no bad religion. It doesn't hurt me nor brings me to my knees. It's not a one man cult. Even though our desires exist online, I just wanna meet you. I hope you come see me perform at Law Revue, make yourself known <3
