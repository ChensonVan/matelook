message=Dear fellow UNSW students,\nOver the past few days i have seen some posts relating to Clare Giang about her obsession with "currys". Although it may seem funny at first, she could really feel uncomfortable with such posts. Please refrain from the constant harassment.\n\nBut if you really are a kinky lady then please hit me up and taste my curry bb
