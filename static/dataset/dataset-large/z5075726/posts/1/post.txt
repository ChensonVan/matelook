message=I remember about a month ago or so I saw an asian girl catching a train from Lidcombe to the city, I'm not even 100% sure you're from UNSW. You caught my eye, and all I remember about you were your orange nails, pink earphones and the fact that you were cute AF. I hope that's a good ego boost cos you deserve it! I'm from USYD and hopefully one day our lives may cross even though it's unlikely, I do look forward to it :P
