message=Just because you know I watch anime it doesn't mean you know me. I hate how everyone around me looks down at me for exploring the 2D lifestyle, for watching my beloved waifu's prancing around me giving off little glances of their panties. PANTSU! \n\nJust so you know. \n\nI am Bokchoy Weaboo Sama and I hail from the land of the glorious pixels. I have travelled here from another dimension in search of a bride at UNSW to bring honour to my famiry. I do not expect much from but these are the conditions that must be met: \n\n- She must have a nice pair of personalities and good curves \n- She must be no taller than 150cm because I am a short man myself and I do not wish to be looked down upon \n\nThose are the conditions and you may find me thirsty, lonely or insecure but I am honestly just tired of fapping all day and lubing up for my body pillows. Hentai grills are not enough for me now and the graphics are starting to wane therefore I must start my journey in search of a real life waifu which offers graphics that far surpass anything that I have ever seen!  With blessings from アフロディテ, I must seek out my beloved and plunge, deep within her, my Excalibur. \n\nThose who wish to extract my Excalibur from their loins, please comment below. \n\nさようなら \n\n- Weaboo Sama
