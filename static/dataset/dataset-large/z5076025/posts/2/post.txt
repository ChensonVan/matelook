message=Dear Jason Khou,\n\nYou look like a cool guy. You seem like you have a good taste in music (not 100% sure if you listen to what I think you listen to). But your peer mentor partner..... GOD DAMN.\n\nHer eyes. They twinkle like the night star. I couldn't keep my (unworthy) eyes off her at the toga party. The way she danced. The way her body moved. \n\nAnd the best thing about her. That smile. The smile that can light up the sorrows of my heart. The way her lips lift upward. The way her teeth are perfectly aligned. The warm glow her happiness gives. Her smile is a ray of sunshine, and I am a sunburn.\n\nJason, pls introduce.\n\nYour peer mentor partner's (soon to be not so) secret admirer
