message=Sorry to the very attractive bibliophile with dark hair that make you shine bright like space does a star, from stats that I didn't ask out. I gave you a smile as you passed and was going to ask you out but thought you looked nervous and tried to avoid me. In hindsight it was my nervousness and I lied to myself to create an excuse to disappear rather than talk. You were probably waiting for me outside the lecture theatre so we could talk but I disapeared after seeing you waiting there, thus sadly I missed the opportunity to make a good friend and for that I am so sorry for my foolishness and hope you know that you are a beautiful person who I would love to talk to.\n Hopefully I get the chance to ask you out next time our paths cross... but I am not expecting a yes. I would love to get to know you better, you remind me of a good book I haven't read yet, but one I will never want to part with. \nWith all of time and space to explore I could use a good companion, so will have to hope you say yes when we meet next.\n\nBest wishes from the man in the red bowtie.
