message=Not at first sight, nor with a tinge of dope\nBut time doth as the subject prove.\nI saw and like, I like but love her I can't.\nO, when mine eyes see Hannah S,\nMethought she purged the air of pestilence.\nHer elegant legs go for miles, that long silky blonde hair,\ncoupled with that goddess smile deemed priceless.\nThat instant was I turned into a hart,\nAnd my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\nlong forgotten that thou exists.\nBe your king beside you, I may not.\nBut that Knight in Shinning armor I shall.
