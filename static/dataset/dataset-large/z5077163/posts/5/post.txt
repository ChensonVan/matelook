message=To a curry guy doing first year commerce at UNSW.\n\nI think they call you Bissy. I am mirin your facial hair. It looks really amazing. I was so enchanted by your appearance that I ran into a wall next to a lecture room. So I am going to need your full name and number for insurance purposes.
