message=To the blonde in the INST1005 lecture,\n\nYour cheeky smile lights up my early Wednesday mornings and makes the disruption of the door more bearable.\nWhen you're not flying off to World Bank meetings, I can feel my heart undertaking in structural adjustment provisions.\n\n...Or, at least that's definitely part of it ;)\n\nWhen I sit near you, I can feel both time and space speeding up, compressing even. \nThis truly is the condition of post-modernity. I love how you care about me and my employment prospects :)\nI can't wait to see more of your illegally acquired World Bank statistics. \n\nYes Anne, I will be joining join you and fellow First Year students for an informal end of semester BInSt get together at ... 'the beer place.' <3\n\nP.S. you can tell this isn't Ivan because I stayed on topic ;)
