message=Mathgirl, I first noticed you in chem1031 early 2011. You were the most beautiful girl in my tute. I was too afraid to talk to you and 2 years later nothing has changed. I like to think that maybe someday I will work up the courage to talk to you properly but I feel I am running out of time. Forever yours, blue eyed, blonde haired chem lover
