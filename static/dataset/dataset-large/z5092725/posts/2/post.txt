message=Dear Ladies of UNSW,\n\nThere's a secret to finding good guys. It’s the shy ones. These types of personalities are the ones who deep within want to talk to you, to compliment you, to make you laugh and smile, to build forts for you, walk in the park, lie outside staring at the stars, just go for long random drives (albeit the soaring petrol prices as a result of the depreciating Australian dollar), have movie nights, make you laugh, cuddle, play fight, play pranks, grasp you close, hold your hand, fall asleep with you, stay up all night talking until we get loopy and talk random, sing back and forth with you (even though we know we are embarrassing ourselves), to spoil you- not because we necessarily want to win you over or are insanely wealthy, but because we love spoiling the people we love- and always be there for you. Sure we’re not always as confident in the way we talk or the way we look as the other guy who approaches any girl they see and gets their number, but you honestly have no idea how much confidence you can boost in a guy by simply saying “hi”. So please girls, try not to take every single person you know for granted- whether you are close to them or they are on the outer. It’s really hard to come by a diamond in the rough who you can just grow with and talk to about your everyday first world problems. You may be inadvertently blind enough to never truly appreciate what you mean to him, or he to you, but many of them will live and die in disappointment for simply not letting a certain someone know. They are the shy ones after all. Oh, and just one more thing, we are also great in bed because all we want to do is please you.\n\nSincerely,\nThe shy kid who accidentally met a girl and wants to continue to please her.\n\nhttp://voices.yahoo.com/image/2270082/index.html?cat=2
