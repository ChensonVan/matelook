message=To the Filipino looking guy from my FINC class,\n\nI think your name's Recks or Rex? \n\nAnyway, i just wanted to say that you had a really nice ponytail but howcome you don't rock with the style anymore?? All i wanted to do when you had the little pony tail was to ride on you and pull on your pony tail while I pegged you from behind.\n\nI'll talk to you soon,\n\nM.P
