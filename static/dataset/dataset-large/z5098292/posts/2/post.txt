message=I'm pretty sure that you already know about it, but I don't like you. I never liked you as a guy from the moment we first met in class.\nI hate it when you talk to me as if there is something going on between us, because there is and will be literally nothing between you and I.\nI thought we were still friends until I found out that you are seeing a girl who you call a cheater, but that's none of my business so why would I care about it.\nBut if you are keep flirting with me and messing around me, making me feel disgusting of myself being friends with you, I would rather not be your friend.\nOne last thing, cheaters are forever cheaters, so don't you ever complain about that you are the cheater's second boy, poor little thing.
