message=I want Evan to know: that the amount I think about you is ridiculous, and that the fact that I am submitting this here is even more so. I always feel like I'm being attention-seeking (probably because I am) but when you actually have time (read as: make time) to talk to me, it is the second most amazing feeling in the world. I believe I already told you what the first was. If you don't remember, it's your hugs. Your hugs are the best. I want to just lie in your arms all day, but that's impractical and I find it difficult to get comfortable... I would definitely like to try it for a shorter period of time though. I should be less of a stalker but you said you don't scare easily, so naturally, challenge subconsciously accepted.
