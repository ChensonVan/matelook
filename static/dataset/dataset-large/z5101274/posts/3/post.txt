message=To the tall asian guy in my Tuesday 2-3 MGMT1001 tute,\n\nI think your name was James? The way you caress your long black hair gets me feeling all tingly in the inside. I wish you would hold me with your strong muscular arms. You seem like the quiet type but Iâ€™ll treat you like my MGMT homework: slam you on the table and do you all night long. Coffee sometime?\n\nLove, \nYour secret admirer
