message=On the 7.15 (From Macarthur) East Hills express into the city this morning (YESTERDAY), I also forgot which stop you got on, you; in a yellow coat were on your iphone looking through the UNSW Love Letters page. I know you'll see this, as youll be checking it sooner or later. I was sitting right next to you, you know who I am (well, kind of).
