message=Saroop Philip, it's about time sometime wrote you actual love letter. I don't have much to say that hasn't been said already, really... I love your sense of humour and the energetic atmosphere you bring. Great to see you around and get moist with the thought of you in my head. \n\nP.S. My friend reckons that Asian guy you hang with is bloody annoying.\n\nRegards, "The Fringe" and "Girl from Queensland".
