message=To the future love of my life, Sonia,\n\nThe girl in my ACCT1A class. I never used to believe in love at first sight but when I first laid my eyes on you, I knew you were the one, you would be the debit to my credit.  I may forever be a liability but having you in my life would be my greatest asset.  I know my love for you will never depreciate, yet continue to accrue for as long as we are together. Coffee sometime?\n\nYour greatest admirer.\nBrown Sugar.
