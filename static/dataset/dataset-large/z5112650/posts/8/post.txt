message=I don't understand how you can go from talking everyday to basically nothing overnight with no good enough explanation or reasoning behind it. I don't care if you don't like me thats fair but let me know your intentions and not lead me on. I don't care if you don't want to talk anymore, but if you've spent months talking to that person/me at least have the decency to give them a reason rather than leaving them to wonder what they may have done wrong with no reason. \nHarambe didn't die for this shit to happen
