message=To the attractive Indian girl in my MTRN lab who always wears glasses, red lipstick and colourful outfits:\n\nYour beauty blows me away when you enter the room\nYou make autumn feel like spring in full bloom\nYou're the prettiest Engineering girl under the sun\nYour hotness is worse than Mech Eng 401 \n\nYou make my heart flutter in a really weird way\nBut it might just be propagation delay\nI hope you don't mind this lengthy admission\nLiking you makes sense, like binary addition\n\nFrom the guy who is legitimately gasping for breath whenever you walk in.
