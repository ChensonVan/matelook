message=This isn't something I do often, and for the record I don't have problems communicating with girls, but something tells me you like public gestures so here goes. Here's me making the first move. Rebecca, you are SO not my type. For one, you're a first year and I'm in my fourth. For another, you live in this little bubble where you are oblivious to how beautiful and amazing you are and just think all the guys who talk to you are only being friendly. Well, they're not. And I refuse to be one of them or to let this go on, so here's me putting an end to it. As I was saying, you're not my type. Meeting you at law camp, I'd thought there was no way I'd ever go for someone as innocent as you, but I guess it's testament to how amazing you are: You have destroyed every standard I have in a woman. I'm not gonna lie and make this more than what it is, I'm not in love with you because only guys with the wrong intentions would say something like that, but I want you to know that I can see myself being in love with you if you were to give me a chance sometime. To the rest of the fellas, she is a beautiful, kind and innocent girl. The last thing she needs is a douchebag looking for arm candy or an easy lay, so if I see one of you pestering her, expect me to tell you off. Well, that's my five minutes. I sincerely hope you won't translate my bucket of honesty into something creepy.
