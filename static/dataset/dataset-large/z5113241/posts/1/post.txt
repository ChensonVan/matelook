message=To the man in black clothing,\n\nYou wore black chinos, and a black hoodie that had no sleeves. The way your smile makes your eyes have a cute squint. The way your biceps come out when you lean on your hand. The way your beard shapes your face perfectly. I saw you during the first week and never saw you again, I miss you. I still remember your voice when you were calling the name simon to the other side of the lecture room.\n\nCome back please,\nI miss you...
