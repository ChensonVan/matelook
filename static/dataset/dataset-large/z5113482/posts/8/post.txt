message=To my Dearest Julia "MATHSOC" Renouf,\n\nYour modelling photos for mathsoc were absolutely exquisite. The way your hands fondled that calculator made me so aroused... Damn was I jealous. The calculator has been graced with the highest honour of them all, with something that I hope to achieve every day, â€” being in your presence. \n\nBut alas you're just an imaginary number to me that has no magnitude nor direction in my life, forever separated from my reality. I can only hope that one day your tangent will intersect my circle of life at the right angle.\n\nSecret Admirer
