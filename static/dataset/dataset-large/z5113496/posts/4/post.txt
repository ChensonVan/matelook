message=To the Asian guy in MATH1151 lectures with amazing fashion sense, never sits at the front. Perfect hair. Wayfarers?. I've heard you giggle from a distance but couldn't catch your name. You're always with some guys so I can never get you alone to say hi :( I think you know who you are, why can't you know who I am too?
