message=To whoever handed in the brown wallet to the library's lost and found, thank you so much. You really saved me from what was already a pretty messed up day, and I really think these small acts of kindness deserve to be recognised more. I haven't even met you in person, and yet I can already tell you're a decent person. Thank you.
