message=Yo sophie\n\nIts been five weeks since you made weird eye contact with me in impromptu design for 3 seconds but the image is now burnt into my mind. Its really annoying that my brain is now preoccupied with someone who i wont see again while i have to deal with first year maff phys and comp as if that wasnt enough. Yeah but you got a real cool smile dont fall over and hurt your face :)\n\nAnon.
