message=Thinking intensely on the bus to uni and I caught you staring at me before you put your sunnies on. Then I saw you again after I had gotten off the bus, gone to IGA and back to the Village Cafe where you once again, there was an intense stare. It's ok all the staring can be excused, you're pretty good looking.
