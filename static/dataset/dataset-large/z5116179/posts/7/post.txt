message=To the gorgeous punjabi guy who studies engineering, i think your name is Andrew Carrass? We have locked eyes at the library lawn coffee cart too many times to ignore our chemistry. You melt my heart like a cheesy naan, please meet me at the Jewel of India in the food court for lunch on tuesday at 2pm. Cannot wait to see you my vishnu lover...\n\nUntil then...
