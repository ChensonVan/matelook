message=To the wonderfully attractive girl with the cracked phone screen catching the express back to Central this afternoon.\n\nIf you think I was casually checking you out, you're mistaken. I was eyeing your food in the brown paper bag as I was starving. What was the contents of this mysterious bag? Spring rolls? A sandwich?  A banana with m&m's? I may never know?!!\n\nMaybe we could meet up for lunch to discuss what it was you that you were having for lunch :)\n\n- sincerely hungry boy on bus ^.^
