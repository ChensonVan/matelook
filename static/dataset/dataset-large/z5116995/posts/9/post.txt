message=Dear z5024986\n\nI've loved you ever since the first time I saw your beautiful rose banner, and the sexy picture of your quadrangle sitting perfectly in your top corner.\n\nNo other page has ever been able to give me the intense rigidity that your timeline gives me. So many glorious, perfectly angled boxes sit in silence begging to be clicked. Where does a boy in love start!\n\nI hope one day I can give you a real thumbs up, but until then my dear collection of data, I will sit eagerly in wait. Following you. Liking you. Scrolling down your lengthy body.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCursor. (Not the bogan rapper)
