message=To my C-Tech crush, \n\nI've been holding this in for a long time, and I just can’t control these emotions anymore. Everyone thought cven2501 was hard enough, but it was harder sitting in the same lecture room as you knowing that I couldn’t run my hands through your voluminous hair. I miss seeing you and your crew having beers at Roundhouse on a Friday night. You always look so perfect in your ralphies. Dreaming of the day our eyes meet across the UNSW main walkway, and we go home together on the Oakes rd bus. \n\nLoving you, \nSecret Admirer
