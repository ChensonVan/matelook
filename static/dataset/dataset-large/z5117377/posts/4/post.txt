message=To the man affectionately known as ‘Bushpig’ I don’t know your real name but ever since I saw you strip down to those budgie smugglers, cowboy boots and bunny ears at law camp, I simply can’t stop thinking about you. Well since I’ve now had the pleasure of seeing you in your most natural form, I think it only right if I reciprocate the favour. I’m studying Criminal Law at the moment and need help learning some of LEPRA’s hardest rules concerning strip searches I hear you run the Law Society Band? Perhaps after Lawlapalooza on Thursday, in order to facilitate my learning objectives, I think a little bit of role-play is in order. How about you play my police officer and conduct a strip search in accordance with section 31 of LEPRA. I’ll provide the handcuffs so long as you promise to be anything but gentle. Oh and btw… you need not comply with section 32 subsections 4-6. http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/leara2002451/s32.html Oh and if for instance your little pig finds its way inside my bush during the search, I’m totally down for that…
