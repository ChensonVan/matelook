message=To the not-so-tall, not-so-dark but immaculately handsome babe called Peter studying Electrical Engineering and Commerce, I just wanted you to know; your smile makes my life worth living, your body is Adonis and the mere thought of your soft lips sends shivers down my spine. Since meeting you I haven’t been craving D, I’ve been craving P ;) Please make my dreams come true... oh wait, you already have just by existing.\n\nLove,\nThe P Craver.\nP.S. I’ve seen you around campus with your girlfriend. She’s a lucky lady for getting to touch dat fine piece of ass.
