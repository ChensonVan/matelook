message=Dear R.W.\n\nWhen you first walked into Clancy with your brown locks and golden tips, I think you gave me some dyspnoea. But if you gave me a cardiac examination, you'd diagnose me with some arrhythmia because I don't think i could control my heart if you touch me. Then again, I wouldn't mind if you sent me into heart failure because I know you can bring me back ;) I saw you at Medball with a guy, but that's okay, I hear that you're a mean girl Regina - I could be a bad boy for you.
