message=To Sarah Lugay, I've been wanting to say this for a really long time and I don't want this to come off weird but... you really are the perfect gamer-girl. I saw you the other day at the PokeSoc gathering and I was too scared to approach you because you looked so hot, but now I have built up the courage to write you a letter. Will you please be the Misty to my Ash because I CHOOSE YOU!
