message=To the girl whom I ran behind for almost 2 kms in the campus!\n\nthe campus is huge. I cant run 1 bit with a bag on my shoulder that has a lappy and chargers and books. Everytime I gathered courage to go talk to her, she went ahead. building to building, me jumping off stairs after stairs..she surely didn't know her way properly i guess or she was confused i suppose..or maybe she knew someone was following her and she was having a great time making my feet tiresome. or whatever.\n\ni dont have the courage to go talk to her because i dont wanna mess up the first conversation itself. i wanna make it perfect. even the 'hii' is gotta be perfect.\n\nhow awesome would it be if she came in front of me and time just stopped?! :D
