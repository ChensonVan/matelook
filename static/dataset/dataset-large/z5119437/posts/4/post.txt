message=To the cute Asian guy with cool hair. I've seen you around everywhere, especially around ASB and the quad with BSOC and TSA. You used to be blonde but now you're brown but I still think you're cute. I always walk by hoping to bump into you and hoping that you'll notice me. I'm the shy Asian girl with the purple bag.
