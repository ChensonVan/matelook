message=Isabella H I'm still in love with you. \n\nDeeply. I've been fond of you ever since we first met all those years ago and I can't stop thinking of you since. And yet I'm so scared of asking you to be the woman of my life because I'm terrified of what could happen, that you do not feel the same, that you are already with another man, that there simply are reasons why we will never be together.\n\nOh Isabella, please: tell me you want to be together with me and I'll be with you forever. Till death do we- no: I will be with you beyond death. Not even He can impede my love for you.
