message=I found you once again amongst the shitheads and arseholes of this world. A diamond in the rough that we call life. You walked passed me today with a hop in your step and a sparkle in your eyes. I actually stopped in front of you to stare, but you simply glided around me and responded with an apologetic nod. I melted and instantly spun around to catch a glimpse of your hair, your smile, your movement. Beautiful you are. I grabbed my phone at an instant and Facebook searched your profile. Hovering over the Add Friend option I hesitate. I hesitate. As your figure disappears amongst the crowded walkway I let out a sigh. MN, I know where you live.
