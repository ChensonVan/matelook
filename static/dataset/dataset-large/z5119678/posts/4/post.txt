message=To the cute white guy in fourth year doing civil/environmental engineering. I love you ðŸ™‚ I don't remember your name or exactly how you look, but that doesn't matter because you are the one for me. I knew it as soon as we talked. Something clicked it was like I had known you forever. But after I met you in the interview, I couldn't get you out of my head. So please can I meet you soon? xx
