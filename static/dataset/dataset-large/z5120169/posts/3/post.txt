message=Dear Mia Maric\nAround you, i fail, to be anything near productive- yet your smile is a distraction i really cannot live without.\nBefore you, i lose, my normal train of thought- I cant, just cant, think the way i normally do.\nClose to you, I feel happy, warm and safe - yet still sad, nervous and insecure.\nEmotions, towards you - I'm unsure if i should show you.\nForever, I think- It would be better if i didn't tell you.\nGreat, I've decided - Lets remain the way we are.
